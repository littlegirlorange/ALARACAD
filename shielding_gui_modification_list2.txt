shielding_gui.pro version/modification list	

050502	display_pet_ct_050502
"Original hacked version (from extract_tumour), built"	
to display PET/CT data saved in .sav format.	

050503	display_pet_ct_050503
Removed extraneous menu items.  Allows for load of	
"PET, CT or tumour data from separate bulk files."	

05090X	display_pet_ct
Changed PET display to reverse greyscale.	

060201	shielding_gui
Started to customize program for observer variability	
study.  Changed common block to info structure so	
that multiple instances of the program can be run.	
"GUI the same as display_pet_ct (no thumbnails,"	
toolbar on the left).	

060203	shielding_gui
Changed the GUI.	

060208	shielding_gui
Program includes basic display and thumbnail functionality.	
Implemented poly_roi and roi_delete.	

060215	
move_roi and move_roi vertex are working.  Added ROI save	
and restore features.	

060217	
"Added freehand ROI tool, double click on thumnail to"
"select main images, fixed image info update on"
thumbnail selection.  Added continuous display of
"ROI motion (vertex and entire), display of crosshairs"
on both PET and CT.  Added pan tool.

060221
Add ROI copy/paste.

060222
Fixed CT only scenario and completely modified layout so
"that thumbnails are now on the left of the screen, not at"
the bottom and the image scroll bar is to the left of the
"PET/CT images, not the right."

060223
Added ROIs to the thumbnail images.  Added a check to
see if the user wants to save ROIs before changing the
image data.  Fixed the thumbnail highlight. Thumbnails
are always unzoomed.

060227
Undo/redo ROI working.  Can undo new vertices and move
but cannot reverse delete.  The undo list is cleared
when the user changes the current ROI.

060228
Now use MKgrROI to draw VP ROIs so that the names of user-
drawn ROIs can be displayed/updated with the ROI.

060229
Implementation of MKgrROI working.  Added ROI renaming
and deletion via right-click menu.

060302
Added copy/paste through right-click menu.  Also
implemented a status/help bar at the bottom of the
window that indicates the current mode and user options.
Changed the automatic naming of ROIs and copied ROIs.

060303
New and exciting nudge tool!

060304
Changed UI setup so that buttons are no longer all
connected through an exclusive base.  On/off states are
"controlled programatically, not automatically.  Each"
button has its own base (necessary for on/off state).
This change was necessary to allow for the appropriate
placement of the nudge tool size selector on the toobar.
Also removed the crosshairs off button.

060310
Added user prefs.

060607 shielding_gui
Basic UI up.  Can load a bitmap and add/delete uptake
points.

060609
First working version.  Can load a simple bitmap and add/
move/delete uptake and imaging points.  Calculates a
weekly dose image from these points.

060614
Added two line ROI options for drawing shields and inputs
for specifying materials and thicknesses.  The output
dose image now accounts for shield attenuation.

060615
Added .tif reader.  Last save before big UI change.

060619
Rearranged UI (tables).  Added popup windows for input of
structure and source specifications.  Added more info
to the tables.  Divided the generic ROI context menu into
structure and source context menus.

060620
Changed vp UI -- only one viewport now.  Fixed context menus
(context menus were not picking up the selected ROI).

060621
Works with SPECT data now.

060622
"Added shielding (lead only, down to 140 keV)."

060627
Added multienergetic tracer handling through the new
MKTracer object.

060627a
Changed zoom so that the mode isn't changed when zoom
is selected.  Zoom out works gradually instead of zooming out
completely.  Recentre now sets zoom to 1.  vp2imgscale no
longer changes with zoom.

060629
Added ROI and session save/open.  Changed ROI delete to accept
a ROI object instead of searching for the current.  Added a
mechanism to destroy extraneous ROIs during SetCurrentROI.

060630
Added query point functionality.

060630a
Fixed viewport size so that zoom will fill the entire
viewport instead of being limited to the original image
dimensions.

060702
"Added user edit of data in tables, turned on or off through"
the b_tables_editable parameter in the user prefs file.
"ROI names cannot be edited in the tables, as at present,"
"the names are used to determined the ROI type (I,U,Q or S)."
Fixed ROI open.

060702a
Prompt for description of query point and added descriptions
to displayed query text.

060702b
Major overhaul of imaging and uptake source recording.
The user can now specify multiple tracers for individual
ROIs (used to be one tracer per ROI).

060703
Version used to generate first set of data sent to Curtis.

060704
Sped up Calculate.  Fixed LinesIntersect.  Removed print
statements.  Created a tracer/shield lookup table.

060705
Further improvements to Calculate.  Moved calls to IDLgrROI:
"getProperty and interp outside of the loop, as they seem"
to be most time consuming.

060706
Changed the way buildup factors are calculated.  Now
determined using a Taylor approximation (from Shultis and
Faw) instead of a lookup table.  Added concrete.

060707
Version used to produce Pembroke results.

060711
Fixed line and right ROIs (LineROIStop and RightROIStop) so
that they no longer have 3 vertices (oops!).  Modified
MoveROIVertex so that right ROIs remain horizontal or vertical
and rectangle ROIs remain rectangles when one vertex is moved.

060712
Improvements to ROI table UI.

060713
Changed table editing to changes are only saved if the user
presses enter.

060724
Version used to generate Osler results.

070228
Converted SPECT version to PET.

070301
Added decay to dose calculation.

070302
Added occupancy factor input for regions and improved
output tables.

070328
"Moved open, save, calculate and some ROI tools out of"
the main program and into their own files.
Added GetIntersection - a function that returns the
point of intersection of 2 lines (required for floor
above and below dose calcs).
Fixed max pixel updating problem.
Added persistent structures that define table
headers.
"Added save of table data (source-region, dose and"
structure info)

070829
Added a view menu with options for grayscale or colour.
Colour option shows regions over 50 uSv and accounts
for occupancy.

070404
Added ROI save/open feature.  Added attachROI so that
individual ROIs can be added to the display.
Modified FileOpen::SaveROIs and FileOpen::OpenROIs.

070415
Added ability to shift display for printing purposes
(shiftTLHC).

070501
"More display features (show/hide DoseMap, Sources,"
"Shields, Regions)."

071213
Even more display features (to show floor shielding
for floor above/below).

071220
Specification of shielding height and height above ground.

080404
Fixed GUI to fit widescreen (laptoppy II).

080407
Added Format->ROIs to menu.  Allows user to change ROI
thickness and text size.  Required changes to
"MKgrROI__define's init, get and set methods."

080412
Added more dosemap colour options.

080509
Added horizontal (floor/ceiling) shielding features.
Changed toolbar bitmaps.

090128
shielding_gui
- neatened number formatting (f8.2) for display and ROI placement (can only specify location to the nearest cm or 0.01 m)
o Scrn2ImgPix, Set*Specs, AddSourceSpecs, ExtendTrimStop, MoveRoiMotion, MoveRoiStop, MoveRoiVertexMotion, FindMax
- fixed bug in shielding_guiAddSourceSpecs
shielding_gui_prompt_box
– added tab-to-next field.
